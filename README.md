# A first non-trivial node.js project

This demonstration project runs under node.js (not in the browser).

It includes the use of at least one third-party library (e.g. lodash).

## installation

```bash
npm install
```

## running
The following command, typed at the terminal when in this repo's directory , will ask node.js to run the commands in the javascript file `src/one.js`

```bash
node src/one.js
```

## making another program

1. Create another file in `src/` directory, e.g. `src/cardRandomiser.js`
  2. Copy the import statement from `src/one.js` for any libraries you want to include
1. Run your new file with node.js from the terminal, e.g.: `node src/cardRandomiser.js`
